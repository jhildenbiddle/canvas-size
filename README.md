Determine the maximum area, height, width, and custom dimensions of an HTML `<canvas>` element.

- üöÄ [Documentation & Demo](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/canvas-size/)
- üî¨ [Test Results](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/canvas-size/#/?id=test-results): HTML `<canvas>` test results for various platforms and browsers

?> Version 2.x contains new features and breaking changes (see the [Changelog](changelog) for details). Documentation for version 1.x is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/canvas-size/blob/v1.2.6/README.md).

## Why?

The [HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element is [widely supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas) by modern and legacy browsers, but each browser and platform combination imposes unique size limitations (see [Test Results](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/canvas-size/#/?id=test-results)) that will render a canvas unusable when exceeded. Unfortunately, browsers do not provide a way to determine what their limitations are, nor do they provide any kind of feedback after an unusable canvas has been created. This makes working with large canvas elements a challenge, especially for applications that support a variety of browsers and platforms.

This micro-library provides the maximum area, height, and width of an HTML canvas element supported by the browser as well as the ability to test custom canvas dimensions. By collecting this information _before_ a new canvas element is created, applications are able to reliably set canvas dimensions within the size limitations of each browser/platform.

## Features

- Determine the maximum `<canvas>` area, height, and width
- Test custom `<canvas>` dimensions
- Web worker + OffscreenCanvas support
- UMD and ES6 module available
- Lightweight (< 1k min+gzip) and dependency-free

## Installation

**NPM**

```bash
npm install canvas-size
```

```js
import canvasSize from 'canvas-size';
```

**CDN**

Available on [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/canvas-size) (below), [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/canvas-size/), and other CDN services that auto-publish npm packages.

```html
<!-- ES Module (latest v2.x.x) -->
<script
  type="module"

```

> üí° Note the `@` version lock in the URLs above. This prevents breaking changes in future releases from affecting your project and is therefore the safest method of loading dependencies from a CDN. When a new major version is released, you will need to manually update your CDN URLs by changing the version after the `@` symbol.
